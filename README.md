The kernel caf√© is a volunteer-run virtual hackerspace for open-source developers and fans.

<img src="docs/photo.jpg">

We provide public infrastructure with new technologies, such as interactive access to ARM & RISCV hardware, IPv6 networking, bleeding-edge kernels, a public mixed-architecture Kubernetes cluster. Most nodes are located in San Francisco, though we are beginning to bring global nodes online as well. 

## Getting access

Just send us a PR that adds your username to the bottom of [auth/users.yaml](auth/users.yaml). Once merged, you will be added to the organization, and able to SSH in with to `<hostname>.kernel.cafe` with the SSH keys you have provided to GitHub (IPv6 required)

## What's the state of the caf√©?

As of Feb 14, 2021, the kernel caf√© is in alpha. We are adding machines weekly, and improving our automation to scale out faster. The nodes are not yet considered stable, but will be when the caf√© hits beta on March 1st.

## Donations

* We are not yet accepting monetary donations, but plan to accept donations to offset power consumption costs via Paypal & GitHub sponsors.
* We are accepting nodes from the community to come join in ([documentation](https://github.com/KernelCafe/automation/)). 
* We are accepting hardware donations for hosts running modern CPU architectures, with a strong preference towards low power consumption. We are very much interested in improving our support for riscv, mips, and ppc64le.
