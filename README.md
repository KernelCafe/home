The kernel caf√© is a volunteer-run virtual hackerspace for open-source developers and fans, providing access to the latest technologies. With it, you get interactive access to connect to hosts running exotic software/hardware combinations, such as:

```
ssh macos.arm64.kernel.cafe
ssh linux.ppc64le.kernel.cafe
```

Most of the nodes are currently located in San Francisco, CA:

## Getting access

If you agree to the ([TERMS_OF_SERVICE.md](terms of service), send a PR adding your user to the end of [auth/users.yaml](auth/users.yaml). Once merged, you will be  invited to the organization, and able to SSH in with to `<hostname>.kernel.cafe` with the SSH keys you have provided to GitHub (IPv6 required). For more information, see [docs/FAQ.md](docs/FAQ.md).

## What's the state of the caf√©?

Alpha. Access to nodes is not expected to be stable until March 1st.

## Donations

* We are not yet accepting monetary donations, but plan to accept donations to offset power consumption costs via Paypal & GitHub sponsors.
* We are accepting nodes from the community to come join in ([documentation](https://github.com/KernelCafe/automation/)). 
* We are accepting hardware donations for hosts running modern CPU architectures, with a strong preference towards low power consumption. We are very much interested in improving our support for riscv, mips, and ppc64le.
