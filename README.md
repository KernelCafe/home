Welcome home, to the Kernel Café! (alpha)

## What is it?

The kernel café is a virtual hackerspace for open-source contributors. We provide public infrastructure with new technologies, such as interactive access to ARM hardware, IPv6 networking, bleeding-edge kernels, a public mixed-architecture Kubernetes cluster. 

## Getting access 

Want access? Send a PR adding a user entry to `users/alpha.yaml`. Our access system authenticates via your GitHub SSH public keys.

## What's the state of the café?

As of Jan 28, 2021, we've installed our first public access host: a M1 Mac Mini. SSH and VNC access are available to it.
